# The Reality of Working as a Foreign Software Developer in South Korea: A Personal Story

After spending more than four years as a software developer in South Korea, I want to share my journey - the challenges, the growth, and the realities that many foreign professionals might face but rarely discuss openly.

## The Initial Dream vs Reality

Like many foreign developers, I came to South Korea with optimism and excitement. The prospect of working in a technologically advanced country, contributing to meaningful projects, and growing professionally seemed perfect. The competitive salary and the opportunity to experience a new culture added to the appeal.

## Remote Work: The Unexpected Isolation

What I didn't expect was how remote work would amplify the cultural challenges. Our team works remotely, and while this setup should promote flexibility and efficiency, it has created unexpected barriers:

- Knowledge sharing becomes minimal
- Team members work in isolated silos
- We rarely know what others are working on
- Company direction and project status remain unclear
- Suggestions for improvements often go unheard
- Team relationships remain surface-level
- Code commit messages in GitHub are in Korean, making code review and understanding change history challenging
- Team meetings are conducted primarily in Korean, leaving you feeling excluded
- Important decisions are often made in Korean conversations, with no English follow-up

## The Language Paradox in Tech

One of the most challenging aspects is the language situation. Despite software development being an internationally English-dominated field, the environment creates an unspoken pressure to learn Korean. This creates a unique paradox:

- Technical discussions that could be in English default to Korean
- Documentation often exists only in Korean
- Git commit messages in Korean make it difficult to track project history
- Code reviews and technical discussions become challenging to follow
- Meeting minutes and important updates are usually in Korean
- Some colleagues are reluctant to use English, even when it would benefit project progress
- International collaboration opportunities are limited
- Your technical expertise becomes secondary to language abilities
- Project context and decisions are harder to understand
- The development workflow becomes fragmented due to language barriers

This language barrier impacts not just communication but also:
- Your ability to contribute effectively to code reviews
- Understanding of project history and decisions
- Participation in technical discussions
- Access to project knowledge
- Daily workflow efficiency
- Team collaboration
- Career growth opportunities

## The Hidden Emotional Toll

The emotional challenges hit hardest during holidays. Korean holidays like Chuseok and Seollal, while beautiful in their cultural significance, can be particularly difficult times:

- The city empties as locals return to their hometowns
- Long breaks become periods of isolation
- The distance from family feels more pronounced
- The reality of being an outsider becomes more apparent

## The Visa Reality

What many don't talk about is the psychological impact of visa renewals. Each renewal period brings:
- Subtle discrimination
- Implications that you should "go back to your country"
- Feelings of instability despite years of contribution
- A reminder of your temporary status

## The Professional Challenge

The workplace hierarchy and culture present unique challenges:
- Ideas for improvement are often suppressed
- Good intentions to help can be misinterpreted
- Collaboration is limited by cultural norms
- Some colleagues display prideful attitudes
- Technical expertise can be overshadowed by cultural expectations

## The Internal Struggle

After four years, I find myself at a crossroads. The stability of a familiar position conflicts with the desire for growth and recognition. The thought process becomes complex:

- Starting over seems risky
- The familiar, even if uncomfortable, feels safer
- The investment of time feels heavy
- The fear of change grows stronger with time

## Moving Forward

Despite these challenges, this experience has taught valuable lessons:
- Technical skills remain valuable globally
- Cross-cultural experience adds unique perspective
- Resilience builds through challenges
- Understanding different work cultures is an asset

## A Message to Others

If you're a foreign developer in South Korea or considering this path:
1. Your technical skills have value, regardless of language barriers
2. The challenges you face are real and valid
3. You're not alone in these experiences
4. It's okay to prioritize your professional growth
5. Cultural challenges don't diminish your technical expertise

## Looking Ahead

Whether choosing to stay or seek new opportunities, remember:
- Your experience here is valuable
- Growth can mean different things
- Taking care of your mental health is crucial
- Change, though scary, might be necessary for growth

The decision to stay or move on isn't just about technical career progression - it's about finding an environment where both your technical skills and overall wellbeing can thrive.
