### Frustration

> It is so stressful to think about that. I sometimes really want to go back to my homeland.

I hear how stressed and overwhelmed you're feeling. It's completely normal to want the comfort and familiarity of home when you're feeling this way. Let's break this down:

Going Back Home Option:
- Pros:
  * Familiar environment and culture
  * No language barrier
  * Close to family and friends' support system
  * Better understanding of the job market
  * More comfortable expressing yourself
  * Less cultural pressure and hierarchy issues
- Cons:
  * Might need to start fresh career-wise
  * Possibly different salary scales
  * Leaving your current medical software experience

For Now:
1. Don't make big decisions while feeling very stressed
2. Take it one day at a time
3. Focus on your mental wellbeing
4. Start quietly exploring job markets in your home country
5. Consider talking to family or friends back home about opportunities

Questions to consider (no need to answer now):
- What kind of opportunities exist in your field back home?
- Do you have any professional connections there?
- Would family/friends be able to help you transition back?

Remember: Wanting to go home isn't giving up - it's recognizing what you need for your wellbeing. Would you like to talk more about what returning home might look like for you? Or would you prefer to just express your feelings about your current situation?

> You know, as an employee, the company can replace us easily? isn't it?

I understand you're feeling vulnerable and replaceable. Let me share a balanced perspective:

Yes and No - here's why:

From Company Perspective:
- Yes, they can technically replace any employee
- Yes, they can find another person for the position

BUT, what they actually lose:
1. Your Specific Value:
- 4+ years of experience with their medical software systems
- Deep understanding of their specific projects
- Knowledge of their processes and workflows
- Relationships with team members
- Time and resources invested in training you

2. Hidden Costs to Them:
- Time and money to recruit someone new
- 3-6 months (minimum) for a new person to get fully productive
- Risk of project delays during transition
- Loss of historical knowledge
- Potential gaps in documentation only you understand

The Reality:
- While companies can replace positions, they can't easily replace experience
- Each person brings unique value and perspective
- Your medical software expertise is specialized
- Good employees are actually hard to find and retain

Remember:
- Your worth isn't determined by your replaceability
- Your experience and skills have value beyond your current role
- Being replaceable in a position doesn't mean you're not valuable

I understand you're feeling undervalued, but try not to let this mindset affect your self-worth. Would you like to talk about ways to recognize and build your unique professional value?

> I really hate the fact that our team are working remotely, and people doesn't share their knowledge and experiences, they just do their job and don't care much about project, team relationship. And what is worst is that we don't know what people is doing, and whether company is going well or not, also for the project we can not say much even we know that it seems not right and would be better if we fix this or improve this or that.

I really understand your frustration. These are legitimate issues that would bother any dedicated professional. Let me break down each of your concerns:

1. Poor Remote Work Culture:
- Lack of collaboration
- Minimal knowledge sharing
- Everyone working in silos
- No team bonding or relationship building

2. Communication Issues:
- No transparency about company status
- Unclear what others are working on
- Limited visibility into project progress
- No clear channels for feedback

3. Improvement Barriers:
- Can't suggest improvements
- Have to watch things being done inefficiently
- Good ideas get ignored or suppressed
- Hierarchical structure blocking innovation

This type of environment is particularly challenging because:
- It goes against best practices in software development
- It prevents team growth and innovation
- It's demotivating for engaged professionals like yourself
- It can lead to inferior product quality
- It wastes valuable insights from team members

This helps explain your depression and frustration because:
- You care about doing good work
- You see potential for improvement
- You value collaboration and knowledge sharing
- You want to contribute beyond just your assigned tasks

It's especially hard when you:
- Have good intentions to improve things
- See problems that could be fixed
- Want to help but aren't allowed to
- Feel isolated despite being part of a team

This isn't just about work - it's about feeling unheard, undervalued, and unable to make meaningful contributions beyond basic tasks. Would you say this accurate reflects how you're feeling about the situation?

> yes, your are right.

I really empathize with your situation. It's particularly difficult when you care about your work and want to make meaningful contributions, but the environment prevents that. 

For your immediate wellbeing, here are some suggestions:

1. Protect Your Mental Health:
- Accept that some things are beyond your control
- Focus on what you can control
- Take breaks when feeling overwhelmed
- Keep work strictly within working hours
- Maintain boundaries with work communications

2. Find Other Outlets:
- Work on personal coding projects that interest you
- Join online communities where you can share knowledge
- Connect with other developers outside your company
- Keep learning new skills for yourself, not the company

3. Mindset Adjustments:
- Think of this as a temporary situation, not permanent
- Focus on gaining experience for your next opportunity
- Remember your worth isn't defined by this environment
- Consider this a learning experience about what you don't want in your next job

4. Daily Coping:
- Set small, achievable goals for yourself
- Celebrate your own wins, even if others don't
- Keep a record of your achievements
- Take care of your physical health
- Maintain connections with friends/family

Would you like to talk more about any of these aspects? Sometimes just having someone understand and validate your feelings can help make the situation more bearable while you plan your next steps.

> It's really hard when you can not express, and also when you did express, but it was ignored. That is why I really want to move, but because I work here for so long, I don't want to risk or try other new job too, this is really hard.

I truly understand this difficult situation you're in - it's like being caught between two painful choices:

1. Staying where you are:
- Feeling unheard and ignored
- Dealing with constant frustration
- Suppressing your ideas and thoughts
- Depression affecting your daily life
- But it's "familiar pain" - you know what to expect
- At least it's stable employment

2. Making a change:
- Fear of the unknown
- Worry about whether a new place might be worse
- Anxiety about starting over
- Risk of making a wrong choice
- But potential for:
  * Being valued and heard
  * Working in a healthier environment
  * Growing professionally
  * Better mental health
  * Renewed motivation

It's completely normal to feel paralyzed by this choice. The "devil you know" can feel safer than the unknown, even when it's hurting you. This is especially true after 4+ years - it's a long time to be somewhere and makes change feel even scarier.

But consider this:
- Is staying worth the cost to your mental health?
- How might you feel after another year in this environment?
- What opportunities might you be missing by staying?
- Isn't there a chance that another workplace could be much better?

Would it help to start very slowly?
1. Just casually look at job postings
2. Maybe have informal conversations with recruiters
3. No commitment, just exploration
4. Take small steps without pressure

Remember: You don't have to make a dramatic decision right now. You can explore options while still keeping your current job. Would you be comfortable with just starting to look, very casually, at what else is out there?

> Maybe, it is just my feeling, and maybe it is only my company, not mostly in South Korea?

While every company is different, what you're experiencing is actually quite common in South Korean corporate culture. Let me explain why:

Typical characteristics of Korean workplace culture:
1. Hierarchy-focused:
- Strong senior-junior relationships
- Top-down decision making
- Limited opportunity for bottom-up feedback
- Expected to follow rather than suggest

2. Communication style:
- Indirect communication preferred
- Avoiding direct confrontation
- Not questioning superiors
- Limited open discussion

3. Group dynamics:
- Group harmony valued over individual input
- Keeping opinions to yourself is often expected
- Innovation might be seen as disruption
- Changes typically come from top management

4. Foreign worker challenges:
- Language barrier creates additional isolation
- Cultural differences in communication
- Often excluded from informal networks
- Harder to understand unwritten rules

This isn't just you or your company - many foreigners in Korean companies face similar challenges. However, there are exceptions:
- International companies in Korea
- Some modern Korean startups
- Companies with more globalized culture
- Teams with international leadership

But given that you:
- Don't want to learn Korean
- Feel uncomfortable with the hierarchy
- Value open communication
- Want to contribute ideas freely
- Prefer collaborative environments

It might be better to look for opportunities:
1. Outside Korea
2. In more internationally-oriented environments
3. Where your communication style is valued
4. Where innovation and input are encouraged

Your feelings are valid - it's not just "in your head." It's a real cultural mismatch that many professionals experience in similar situations. Would you like to explore what kinds of work environments might be a better fit for your working style?

> Since you are now understand me and my situation. Please try to writing many stories to encourage me and motivate me instead of being stuck in my depression mode.

Let me share some encouraging perspectives that I hope will help lift your spirits:

Story 1: The Bird in a Small Cage
Imagine a talented bird, living in a small cage. The bird has beautiful songs to share, but the cage limits its ability to sing freely. One day, the bird realizes - the cage door isn't locked. While the familiar cage feels safe, the whole sky awaits. Just like this bird, you have valuable talents and ideas to share. The tech world is vast, and somewhere out there is a place where your songs (your ideas and contributions) will be truly appreciated.

Story 2: The Hidden Gem
Think of yourself as a precious gem that's currently in the wrong setting. Just because the current setting doesn't showcase your brilliance doesn't diminish your value. Your experience in medical software development is valuable - you're creating solutions that help people's lives. Every line of code you write could be improving someone's healthcare experience. That's meaningful work, regardless of whether your current environment recognizes it.

Story 3: The Growing Tree
You're like a tree that's grown in rocky soil for 4 years. Despite the challenging environment, you've developed strong roots (experience), grown taller (skills), and produced leaves (completed projects). Now you're strong enough to be transplanted to more fertile soil where you can truly flourish. Your resilience through these challenges has made you stronger.

Story 4: The Marathon Runner
Think of your career as a marathon, not a sprint. Right now, you're just at a challenging part of the course. Every marathon has its tough sections - uphill climbs, rough terrain, harsh weather. But these challenging sections don't last forever. Keep moving forward, even if it's just small steps. The next better section of the course is ahead.

Story 5: The Master Chef
Imagine a talented chef working in a kitchen that only wants to serve one type of dish. The chef has ideas for amazing new recipes but isn't allowed to try them. Does this make the chef any less skilled? No! It just means they need to find a kitchen that values creativity and innovation. Your technical skills and innovative ideas are like those recipes - they just need the right kitchen.

Remember:
- Your current situation is temporary
- Your value isn't determined by your current environment
- Your ideas and desire to improve things show you care about quality
- Your frustration comes from a good place - wanting to do better
- Your experience in medical software is valuable globally
- Your resilience through these challenges shows your strength

The tech world needs people who:
- Care about doing things right
- Want to share knowledge
- Think about improvements
- Consider team dynamics
- Take pride in their work

These are exactly the qualities you've described, even if they're not appreciated now. Would you like to hear more encouraging perspectives? Sometimes just shifting our viewpoint can help us see new possibilities.
