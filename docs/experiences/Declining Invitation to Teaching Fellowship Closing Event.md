## Declining Invitation to Teaching Fellowship Closing Event

> As you see, I don't want to join the event because of such depression, and I want to close up myself. Just working only on my full time job.

I completely understand now why you don't want to attend the event. Given your depression and emotional state, it's completely reasonable to:

1. Protect your mental energy by:
- Skipping non-essential social events
- Focusing only on your core job responsibilities
- Taking time to process your feelings
- Avoiding situations that might add to your emotional burden

2. Handle the event decline gracefully:
- Send a simple, professional email declining the invitation
- You don't need to provide detailed explanations
- Something brief like: "Thank you for the invitation. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the closing ceremony. I appreciate having had the opportunity to contribute to the program."

3. Focus on self-care:
- Maintain basic routines
- Get enough rest
- Take breaks when needed
- Don't force yourself into social situations that feel overwhelming right now

It's perfectly okay to pull back and conserve your emotional energy while you're dealing with depression. Sometimes we need to focus just on getting through each day. Would you consider seeking professional help or counseling services that offer support in English? You don't have to go through this alone.

Remember: Your mental health comes first. You don't need to feel guilty about declining the invitation or limiting your social engagements while you're struggling.

> Wait, the reason I didn't want to join the event is also because if I joined the event, for the future It gonna be hard to decline the part time job in the future.


Ah, now I understand even better! This is a very valid and strategic concern. Let me break down why your instinct to decline the event is actually quite wise:

1. Setting Clear Boundaries:
- Attending might signal continued interest
- Could create expectations for future involvement
- Harder to say "no" after maintaining social connections
- They might use the event to discuss future opportunities

2. Clean Break Strategy:
- Not attending helps create clear closure
- Easier to decline future requests
- Avoids awkward conversations about future participation
- Prevents emotional pressure to continue

3. Professional Psychology:
- In Korean culture especially, maintaining relationships often comes with obligations
- Attending social events can be seen as maintaining professional ties
- Could be interpreted as being open to future collaboration
- Saying "no" later might be seen as going back on an implied commitment

This adds even more weight to your decision to decline. Your instinct to create distance now is:
- Professional
- Strategic
- Self-protective
- Forward-thinking

Would you like help crafting a response that politely declines both the event AND preemptively discourages future teaching requests? This could help set clear boundaries for the future while maintaining professionalism.


You're absolutely right - keeping it simpler and not mentioning future plans or commitments is cleaner and more professional.

Here's the revised, simpler version:

```
Dear [Organizer's name],

Thank you for the kind invitation to the Lee Jong-wook Fellowship Clinical Program Closing Ceremony and dinner.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the events on November 22nd.

I wish the fellows success with their action plans and future endeavors.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

This version:
- Keeps it brief and clear
- Doesn't give unnecessary explanations
- Maintains professionalism
- Closes the matter politely
- Leaves no room for follow-up questions
- Doesn't invite further discussion
